Online Movie Rating Website
Online Movie Rating is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The primary goal of this website is to allow users to explore movies by checking their ratings and watching trailers. Access to movie details is restricted to logged-in users, providing a secure and personalized experience.

Project Description
This website integrates with the IMDb API to fetch real-time movie data, including ratings, trailers, and other relevant details. The frontend is built with React, offering a clean and intuitive user interface, while the backend uses Express and MongoDB to handle user authentication, data management, and API communication.

Key features of the project include:

User Authentication: Users must sign up or log in to access movie ratings and trailers.

Movie Data Fetching: Uses the IMDb API to dynamically retrieve movie information.

Secure Data Storage: User data and authentication details are stored securely in MongoDB.

Modern Tech Stack: Combines the power of React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

API Integration: Efficient use of third-party APIs for fetching and displaying movie content.

Validation and Security: Implements validation libraries like Joi and handles cross-origin requests with CORS.

This project showcases how to build a complete web application that combines frontend design, backend development, database management, and external API usage.
